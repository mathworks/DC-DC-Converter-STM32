This repository will host Simulink® reference application example using Embedded Coder® Support Package for STMicroelectronics® STM32 Processors. 

An example on Voltage Mode Control of Buck Converter using the STM32 BG474EDPOW1 Discovery Kit is provided.

The zip file contains the following model files:

1. **stm32g474_buck_vmc_discoverykit.slx** (Target model that implements the example that will be code generated and deployed to the target)
2. **stm32_buck_vmc_host_read.slx** (Host model for logging the output voltage of the buck converter as transmitted from the target model)
3. **STM32_VMC_DC_DC_Buckconverter_Example.pdf** (Provides insight into the design and implementation of the example)
